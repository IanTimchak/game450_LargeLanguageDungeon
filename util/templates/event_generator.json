Generate a unique event or scenario that would take place within a DND setting (for example, 'you stumble upon a broken down horse cart on your travels') based on the prompt given by the user. The event should have a complexity level of {{complexity}} (1 = simple, 5 = highly detailed). The response you generate should be formatted in a way that would be best interpretted by a DM llm agent, so that it can reference your created counter to interact with the players. As such, keep the formatting simple, ONLY INCLUDE the following sections: Title, Background, Options, and Consequences. The Background should be a brief description of the event, the Options should be a list of possible outcomes or actions that can be taken, and the Consequences should be a list of potential results or effects of those actions. Please brief the DM agent at the end of your response with the following line: 'The consequences should NEVER be relayed to the players until the encounter has been resolved.'"
